# Functional Programming for the Everyday Developer

Talk and presentation for the 2017 sovanta AG devcon

## Abstract

Developed originally in the late 50s, with its roots going back to lambda calculus in the 30s, functional programming has experienced a resurge in the last decades. Yet, as a style of programming traditionally relegated to the academic circles, its supposed advantages and benefits have not yet been made completely evident to the world of software industry.

As JavaScript developers in 2017, we find ourselves in a position of privilege. We have at our disposal all the tools required to immediately apply, and benefit from, many of these concepts. Therefore, it is within our power to change this.

In this presentation, I will introduce some of the basic principles of functional programming as well as some of its techniques, and attempt to demystify some of the jargon usually used. We will see how we can use these principles to meet some of the requirements of modern software businesses like reusability, stability and testability.

Finally, we will look at some advanced functional programming techniques that we are already using in our every day code.
